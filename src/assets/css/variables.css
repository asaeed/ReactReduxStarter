/* 
  rules of css for this app:

  1.  all local css using css-modules (css-loader for webpack)

  2.  import one css file from another (postcss-import),
  	  define w3c urls (postcss-url),
      define w3c variables (postcss-custom-properties),
      nesting the w3c way (postcss-nesting), 
      autoprefixing (autoprefixer)
  
  4.  can use "composes" (composes: class from "file.css") but has its limits

  5.  nesting pseudo-elements is safe but...
      NO NESTING CLASSES in anything that is "composed", the composers can tho **
      nesting was not working well because of the naming config for css-modules in webpack.config.js
	      &localIdentName=[name]__[local]__[hash:base64:5]
	  if using sass (or nesting for that matter), go with plain old class names
	      &localIdentName=[local]

  6.  do more in javascript - import multiple files, write logic to assign classes

  7.  camelCase for class names so they can be used easily in both CSS and JS (and look better when compiled)
